I am currently a [Lecturer](https://jd.haust.edu.cn/info/1211/75136.htm) at the School of Mechatronics Engineering, Henan University of Science and Technology (HAUST).

Previously,I received my Ph.D degree in the [School of Mechanical Science and Engineering](https://en-mse.hust.edu.cn/index.htm), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/). My supervisor is [Prof. Fangyu Peng](https://en-mse.hust.edu.cn/info/1085/2053.htm). 

And, I received my B.S. degree from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

My research interests lie in dynamical systems, optimal control, manipulation, continuous contact tasks.

My recent work has focused on learning and generalizing skills in manipulation tasks. The main directions are:
- Data Learning in Riemannian Spaces
- Asymmetric Collaborations
- Adaptive Manipulation Control in Uncertain Environments
